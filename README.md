## About
KootzGame began as a High School research project on game development and has morphed into a passion project. <br/>
It's final name has since been revealed as *Squire* and more recent builds can be found at squire.ktzdev.com/builds. <br/>
Feel free to reach out if you'd like to see some of the code. Since it is still in production, I am not planning on <br/>
posting all of the code in the near future.
## Project History
The original idea for the game was developed in the Spring of 2021, but morphed considerably from then <br/>
Originally, I had planned a large, 40+ hour role-playing game, but it soon became obvious that I did not have <br/>
the skill to complete a working prototype by Spring 2022, when I was required to submit a version to my high schoool <br/>
Thus, I reorganized the game into "An RPG that can be played in 20 minutes," focusing on procedural generation and <br/>
replayability. In the near future, I am working on implementing basic classes for NPCs and procedural town generation <br/>
